            My colleague and coworkers have described me as dependable, trustworthy, honest, and hard-working.
            I have experience in customer service through positions at The University of Oklahoma and Tulsa Community College.
            I will be graduating in December 2021, and I plan to pursue a career working with databases or be a software developer.
            I will seek a position that aligns with my value and help a company improve its database or develop code to assist the company.
            As I continue with my degree, I will seek new skills and form a well-rounded professional network.
            Please feel free to connect with me or inform me of any potential opportunities.
